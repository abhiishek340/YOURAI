Your AI is powered by some fancy tech stuff like smart computer brains and secure communication tricks. This makes sure your info stays safe and that the system runs smoothly. It also makes it easy for different hospitals to talk to each other and for you to get personalized advice from Your AI.

**How Your AI Was Made**

We built Your AI as part of the Princeton University Hackathon, where a bunch of smart folks got together to solve big problems. We did a bunch of research to understand what people struggle with in healthcare. Then, we used simple tools like React and Node.js to build Your AI, making it easy for everyone to use.

**Challenges We Overcame**

Building Your AI wasn't always smooth sailing. We had to figure out how to handle tricky data and make sure Your AI could understand personal info without getting confused. But with teamwork and determination, we found solutions to these challenges and made Your AI even better.

**Proud Moments and Big Impact**

One of our proudest achievements is seeing Your AI in action, helping real people get better care. Despite the hurdles we faced, we built something powerful that makes a positive difference in people's lives. Your AI gives you personalized advice based on your own info, and that's something to be proud of.

**What We Learned Along the Way**

Through building Your AI, we learned a lot about how to use computers to solve big problems. We discovered the importance of keeping things simple and making sure everyone can use the tech we build. Most importantly, we learned that even small teams can make a big impact when they work together.

**What's Next for Your AI**

Looking ahead, we're excited to keep improving Your AI. We want to make it even smarter by giving it more info to work with and making it easier for you to use. By staying up-to-date with new tech and listening to feedback, we're confident that Your AI will continue to be a game-changer in healthcare.
